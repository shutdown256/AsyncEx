# AsyncExCore
Conversion of AsyncEx Library into .NET Core RC2

Original project: https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx

I claim no real authorship, ownership or contribution to this codebase. I just cloned the orinal library and hacked around it until it compiled.
As of yet original AsyncEx does not target .NET Core RC2 (only RC1)

supports both NETStandard1.5 and .NET Framework 4.5.1

## Getting Started

Install the [NuGet package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Nito.AsyncEx.Core).
