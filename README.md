# AsyncExCore
Conversion of AsyncEx Library into .NET Core RC2

Original project: https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx

I claim no real authorship, ownership or contribution to this codebase. I just cloned the orinal library and hacked around it until it compiled.
As of yet original AsyncEx does not target .NET Core RC2 (only RC1)
